## Introduction

The device allows people to pay for purchases using electronic passes. This solution allows vending companies not to worry about problems with cash (banknotes and coins), encashment and change, increasing the number of customers served per unit of time, what, in its turn, increases the income of the organization. And for the ultimate buyer, this method of payment saves time greatly.

## Features of a Cashless-Device

Card payments have been rapidly growing in popularity, overtaking cash in the last few years as the most popular form of payment. Mobile app payments are gradually becoming common place too. It’s so called as digital era, and we all need to keep up.
The ease of conducting financial transactions is probably the biggest motivator to go digital. You will no longer need to carry wads of cash, plastic cards, or even queue up for ATM withdrawals. It’s also a safer and easier spending option when you are travelling.

## SWOT Analysis:

## Strength:

* If all transactions are on record, it will be very easy for people to keep track of their spending.
* The written record will help you keep tabs on your spending and this will result in better budgeting.
* Easy to enjoy **GO DIGITAL, GET DISCOUNTS** Formula.

## Weakness:

* While there is no denying the convenience of card or mobile wallet transactions, it could open a spending trap for an unsuspecting population.

## Opportunity:

* It may not seem like much of an advantage, but being cashless makes it easy to ward off borrowers.
* If stolen, it is easy to block a credit card or mobile wallet remotely, but it’s impossible to get your cash back.


## Threats:

* * The biggest fear is the risk of identity theft. Since we are culturally not attuned to digital transactions, even well-educated people run the risk of falling into phishing traps
* Since you will be dependent on your phone for all your transactions on the move, losing it can prove to be a double whammy.
